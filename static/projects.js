        description:`Fine-tuned a very small LLM T5 (770M parameters only) on a GPT-generated dataset (CodeAlpaca) using Supervised Finetuning (SFT).
        â€¢Later, the SFT-tuned model is re-tuned using RLHF (Reinforcement learning from human feedback) using our own Human Preferences, resulting 19.5 Pass@1 and 44.2 Pass@100 on the HumanEval benchmark.`,
